Nth Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is o, the second number is 1, and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as FO = 0
and F1 = 1. For the purpose of
this question, the first Fibonacci number is FO; therefore, getNthFib getNthFib(1) is equal to FO, getNthFib (2) is equal to F1, etc..
